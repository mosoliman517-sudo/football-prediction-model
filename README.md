## Football Match Prediction Model

## Goal

Build a machine learning model that predicts football match outcomes using historical Premier League data and pre-match statistics such as recent form, team strength, home advantage, and other performance metrics.

# Progress Log

## Update 1 — April 30 – June 5, 2026

- Set up the initial football prediction project structure and data pipeline.
- Collected historical Premier League match data from https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php.
- Cleaned the raw datasets by removing unnecessary information and duplicate betting-market features.
- Developed a feature engineering pipeline using Python and Pandas.
- Created form-based metrics including:
  - Last 5 match points
  - Home and away specific form
  - Recent form rankings
- Developed an opponent strength metric based on the average ranking of each team's previous five opponents.
- Added attacking and defensive performance features including:
  - Average goals scored
  - Average goals conceded
  - Goal difference
  - Average shots
  - Average shots on target
  - Average shots conceded
- Added contextual match features:
  - Rest days between matches
  - Home and away performance trends
- Removed data leakage by ensuring only information available before kickoff is used.
- Generated the first engineered dataset (`E0_features.csv`).

## Update 2 — June 6 – July 22, 2026

- Expanded the project from one Premier League season to ten seasons of historical data (~3,800 matches).
- Redesigned the data loading pipeline to automatically merge multiple seasons.
- Fixed cross-season compatibility issues including inconsistent date formats.
- Successfully validated the combined dataset (3,801 matches, 130 raw columns).
- Confirmed that the feature engineering pipeline scales correctly across multiple seasons.

---

## Update 3 — July 23 – July 30, 2026

Successfully trained and evaluated the first generation of machine learning models using the engineered dataset.

Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms:

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

### Current Best Result

- **Best model:** Gradient Boosting
- **Accuracy:** **57.1%**
- **Evaluation season:** 2023–24 Premier League

Additional improvements:

- Reorganized the project into a cleaner and more modular structure.
- Split the feature engineering pipeline into dedicated modules:
  - Form
  - Goals
  - Shots
  - Rest Days
  - Elo Ratings
- Added a model comparison pipeline to benchmark multiple machine learning algorithms.
- Added evaluation tools including:
  - Feature importance rankings
  - Prediction probabilities
  - Confusion matrices
- Improved the readability and scalability of the codebase, making future feature additions significantly easier.
